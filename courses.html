    <h2>Digital Photography and Color Management</h2>
	<p>Professor Brian Lawler shows us different photo techniques to handle. A lot of attention is given to color management. You have very cool assignments. The lectures are always very amusing to watch, because Brian is a very funny person.
    I never had a professor as good as Brian. He's humorous, student-oriented, helpful and very intelligent. It's very hard not to be bad in the subject, because he knows how to teach it to everybody, so that something gets stuck. I think it is a great pity that there are no real courses because of this Corona virus.
    It's definitely my favorite class.</p>
    <h2>Web Design and Production</h2>
	<p>Here Jeff and April explain the structure of a website and its components. Through many assignments and exercises, the knowledge and the construct of a website are quickly and easily conveyed.
    Some of them are relatively time-consuming jobs, so it is an advantage not to start at the last moment. But you have enough time to cope with them. 
    It is an advantage if you have attended the preliminary course 338, which gives you the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. In 339 you will also be taught simple tools that you can consolidate on this basic building block.</p>
    <h2>Magazine Design Technology</h2>
    <p>A very practical subject, where you design an 8-page magazine of the entire quarter. Every week there is a review of the respective work order via zoom. The second project is a 3D representation of the front and back covers.
    You really have to work very disciplined in order to attend the midterm exams, the assignments and the online lectures on time. It's really a lot of fun, because you work extensively with the Adobe programs. In addition, you are encouraged by outside influence, such as when, for example, guest critics from companies are available for critique.
        Every now and then you despair because something doesn't work out, but the effort and ambition are worth it in the end when you see the final result.</p>
